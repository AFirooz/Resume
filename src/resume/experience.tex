                %
                \item{Developed a Python pipeline for parsing, cleaning, verifying, and loading data onto the database, leveraging multiple frameworks including Numpy, Pandas, etc. The data are processed from Prisma Health, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of data management processes}
                %
                \item{Conducted research on machine learning (ML) algorithms (using the Scikit-Learn library), including tree-based methods (Decision Trees, Random Forest), and gradient boosting techniques (XGBoost, AdaBoost, CatBoost), to classify patient responses to different combinations of 65 medications. Employed evaluation metrics (CM, F1, recall, precision, etc.) to assess model performance. Visualized the result (using SHAP) for enhanced interpretability and decision-making, while addressing class imbalance issues (using down sampling, SMOTE) and ensuring robust and reliable predictions.}

                \item{Managed high-throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) data (\textbf{over 6.9 billion data points} across 78 files), storing it into a MySQL database by leveraging the advantages of SQLAlchemy's asyncio methods to expedite the process. Explored neural networks like ResNet and CNN to differentiate between cancerous and surrounding tissues based on the processed data}
                %
                \item{Applied dimension reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, ISOMAP) to perform cluster analysis and reveal natural groupings in data comprising over \textbf{77,000} small molecules and their chemical descriptors. Performed retention time prediction for these small molecules based on their chemical descriptors. Trained baseline models for initial feature selection and data understanding.}
